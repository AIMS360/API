4.  Check the status of the job by sending a request to

`POST /jobsmanagement/v1.0/backgroundjob?\$filter=jobId eq'{{JobID}}'`

For more details about the Job status API [click
here](https://github.com/AIMS360/API/tree/master/Jobs).

Once the job status is received as Completed, the output can be obtained using
publishlink.

5.  To get the output/result send a request to the Publishlink URL. Based on the
    Publish Access Scope, Bearer Token needs to be passed for authentication. If
    the preferred outformat is CSV or excel, the file will be returned and if
    the preferred output format is JSON, the JSON will be returned.

Once after extracting the required data using Aqua endpoint, the
latest/refreshed data can be obtained using the same Job ID and publishlink
returned by the Aqua endpoint when called.

1.  Obtain a valid access token. [Click
    here](https://github.com/AIMS360/API/blob/master/README.md) to know how to
    generate access token

2.  Place a request to Rerun Job API passing JobID

`POST jobsmanagement/v1.0/backgroundjob?\$filter=jobId eq'{jobID}'/rerun`

3.  The API returns the JobID, job status, publishlink and publishlink access
    scope in the response.
